# Capital-Cities
100 Days of Swift (Project 16) An app that shows the locations of capital cities around the world using MapKit, and when one of them is tapped you can bring up more information.
Throughout the course of this project, I learned about MKMapView, MKAnnotation, CLLocationCoordinate2D, and more.

In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Try typecasting the return value from dequeueReusableAnnotationView() so that it's an MKPinAnnotationView. Once thatâ€™s done, change the pinTintColor property 
to your favorite UIColor.

-Add a UIAlertController that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a mapType property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, 
.satellite gives a satellite view of the terrain.

-Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
